* measures of dispersion such as IQR,variance,standard deviation,covariance
* visual representation of correlation of dataframes such as pairplot,scatterplot,heatmap
* visual representation of skewness
* univariate analysis
   * histograms
   * distplot
   * violinplot
   * cumulative distribution
* multivariate analysis
   * scatterplots between multiple variables
   * heatmaps
   * hue option in scatterplots
* handling categorical data
   * one hot encoding
   * sklearn label encoding
   * sklearn one hot encoding
* normalisation and scaling
   * sklearn standard scaler normalisation
   * sklearn MinMaxScaler
   * log transformation
   * exponential transformation
* handling null values
* handling duplicates
* handling unwanted or incorrect observations
* working with outliers
   * using visualization tools such as boxplots,scatterplots to find outliers
   * using statistical rules such as z score to find outliers.
