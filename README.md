In this file I have performed the following operations:-
* descriptive statistics such as mean,median,mode,5 number suheatmmary
* measures of dispersion such as IQR,variance,standard deviation,covariance
* visual representation of correlation of dataframes such as pairplot,scatterplot,heatmap
* visual representation of skewness
* univariate analysis
   * histograms
   * distplot
   * violinplot
   * cumulative distribution
* multivariate analysis
   * scatterplots between multiple variables
   * heatmaps
   * hue option in scatterplots
* handling categorical data
   * one hot encoding
   * sklearn label encoding
   * sklearn one hot encoding
* normalisation and scaling
   * sklearn standard scaler normalisation
   * sklearn MinMaxScaler
   * log transformation
   * exponential transformation
* handling null values
* handling duplicates
* handling unwanted or incorrect observations
* working with outliers
   * using visualization tools such as boxplots,scatterplots to find outliers
   * using statistical rules such as z score,IQR to find outliers.
   * correcting outlier values with median or upper limit or lower limit of iqr
* Bivariate analysis
   * numerical vs numerical data representation using scatterplot,heatmap
   * categorical vs numerical representation using violinplot,barplot
   * categorical vs categorical using bar chart,point plot
   * checking trends using temporal data
 * pandas profiling
